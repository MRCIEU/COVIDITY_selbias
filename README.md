## ***COVIDITY BHF-Project - Working Package 3 about selection bias in COVID-19 studies across UK cohorts***

This repository contains the pipeline of the analyses performed to inform about and reduce potential selection bias in COVID-19 studies. Files contain R code that can be used as a template for running these analyses in other cohorts.

1. Steps to create the dataset(s) with the COVID-19 outcomes and the potential predictors of selection (**folder 0.datasets**).

2. Steps and code to assess whether potential predictors of selection are associated with outcomes of COVID-19 related to being selected into the sample (**folder 1.aim1-predictors**).

3. Steps and code to explore bias due to selection in the association of particular risk factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity:

   a. Empirical analysis exploring potential bias in the estimated associations of BMI, sex and smoking with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity (**folder 3.aim3-examples**).

   b. Simulation studies exploring potential bias in the estimated association of BMI with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity (**folder 2.aim2-simulation**).

4. Steps and code to explore methods to mitigate bias due to selection into COVID-19 studies(**folder 4.aim4-methods_selbias**).
