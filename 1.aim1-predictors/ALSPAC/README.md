# Assessing candidate predictors of selection into SARS-CoV-2 ALSPAC subsamples

This corresponds to the **univariable logistic** regression analyses of candidate predictors of selection into SARS-CoV-2 ALSPAC subsamples (***"SECTION 2: EMPIRICAL COHORT ANALYSES" - Assessing candidate predictors of selection into SARS-CoV-2 subsamples***). The outcome was **SARS-CoV-2 infection**, and we assessed 4 comparisons: 

i) **Assessed VS non-assessed**
>Having data on SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to having no data (reply to COVID-19 questionnaire vs no answer to COVID-19 questionnaire)

ii) **SARS-CoV-2 (+) vs non-assessed**
>Assessed as having had SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to having no data (reported as COVID-19 in COVID-19 questionnaire vs no answer to COVID-19 questionnaire)

iii) **SARS-CoV-2 (-) vs non-assessed**
>Assessed as not having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to having no data (reported as non-COVID-19 in COVID-19 questionnaire vs no answer to COVID-19 questionnaire)

iv) **SARS-CoV-2 (+) vs SARS-CoV-2 (-)**
>Assessed as having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to assessed as not having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection (reported as COVID-19 vs reported as non-COVID-19 in COVID-19 questionnaire)
