# Deriving variables

This folder contains code for deriving the SARS-CoV-2 infection and death-with-COVID-19 outcome variables, and the candidate predictors of selection.

See details specific to each cohort in each subfolder.

## Derive Outcomes 

Outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection:

-**Assessed VS non-assessed**

-**SARS-CoV-2 (+) vs SARS-CoV-2 (-)**

-**SARS-CoV-2 (+) vs non-assessed**

-**SARS-CoV-2 (-) vs non-assessed**

-**SARS-CoV-2 (+) vs “everyone else”**

Outcomes related to Death with COVID-19:

-**Death-with-COVID-19 vs assessed**

-**Death-with-COVID-19 vs SARS-CoV-2 (-)**

-**Death-with-COVID-19 vs SARS-CoV-2 (+)**


## Derive candidate predictors of selection

The candidate predictors of selection used are specific to each cohort.
These are described in Supplementary Table 1 of the paper.
