COVIDITY BHF-Project - Working Package 3 about selection bias in COVID-19 studies across UK cohorts

This repository contains the pipeline of the analyses performed to inform about and reduce potential selection bias in COVID-19 studies. Files contain R code that can be used as a template for running these analyses in other cohorts.

1. Steps to create the dataset(s) with the COVID-19 outcomes and the potential predictors of selection.

2. Steps and code to extract descriptive tables of the variables analysed as potential predictors of selection in each subset, and to run univariate logistic regression models, which addresses aim 1 of this project - whether those potential predictors of selection are associated with the defined outcomes of COVID-19.

3. Steps and code to run multivariate logistic regression models for three illustrative examples (sex, BMI and smoking), which addresses aim 3 of this project - whether those potential predictors of selection are associated with the defined outcomes of COVID-19.
