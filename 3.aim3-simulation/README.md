# Simulations in UK Biobank and ALSPAC

These simulations aimed to determine the potential magnitude and direction of bias due to selection and misclassification (in 'everyone else' analyses) in observational covid studies.

The code for the simulations for each cohort are found in their respective subdirectories.

These simulation use Stata on BlueCrystal phase 3.

Load Stata with:

```
