## ***COVIDITY BHF-Project - Working Package 3 about selection bias in COVID-19 studies across UK cohorts***

This repository contains the pipeline of the analyses performed to inform about and reduce potential selection bias in COVID-19 studies. Files contain R code that can be used as a template for running these analyses in other cohorts.

1. Steps to create the *dataset(s)* with the COVID-19 outcomes and the potential predictors of selection (**folder _0.datasets_**).

2. Steps and code to assess whether *potential predictors of selection* are associated with *outcomes of COVID-19 related to being selected into the sample* (**_1.aim1-predictors_**).

3. Steps and code to explore bias due to selection in the association of *particular risk factors* with *SARS-CoV-2 infection* and *COVID-19 severity*:

   a. *Empirical analysis* exploring potential bias in the estimated associations of BMI, sex and smoking with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity (**_3.aim3-examples_**).

   b. *Simulation studies* exploring potential bias in the estimated association of BMI with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity (**_2.aim2-simulation_**).

4. Steps and code to explore *methods to mitigate* bias due to selection into COVID-19 studies (**_4.aim4-methods_selbias_**).
