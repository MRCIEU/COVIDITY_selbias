This corresponds to the **multivariable logistic** regression analyses of the association between BMI and **SARS-CoV-2 infection** (***"SECTION 2: EMPIRICAL COHORT ANALYSES - Exploring bias due to selection in the association of BMI with SARS-CoV-2 infection and death-with-COVID-19"***). Complete case models were adjusted for *age, sex, smoking status, educational attainment* and *Index of Multiple Deprivation*.

Comparisons were:

i) **SARS-CoV-2 (+) vs SARS-CoV-2 (-)**
>Assessed as having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to assessed as not having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection (reported as COVID-19 vs reported as non-COVID-19 in COVID-19 questionnaire)

ii) **SARS-CoV-2 (+) vs “everyone else”**
>Assessed as having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to assessed as not having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection OR no data (reported as COVID-19 vs reported as non-COVID-19 OR no answer to COVID-19 questionnaire)
