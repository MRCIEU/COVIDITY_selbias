This corresponds to the univariable logistic regression analyses of candidate predictors of selection into SARS-CoV-2 ALSPAC subsamples ("SECTION 2: EMPIRICAL COHORT ANALYSES"). The outcome is SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we assessed 4 comparisons: 
i) having data on SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to having no data (reply to COVID-19 questionnaire vs no answer to COVID-19 questionnaire)
ii) assessed as having had SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to having no data (reported as COVID-19 in COVID-19 questionnaire vs no answer to COVID-19 questionnaire)
iii) assessed as not having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to having no data (reported as non-COVID-19 in COVID-19 questionnaire vs no answer to COVID-19 questionnaire)
iv) assessed as having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to assessed as not having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection (reported as COVID-19 vs reported as non-COVID-19 in COVID-19 questionnaire)
